// To give an accurate explanation, let's break down the { component: Component, ...rest } expression into two separate operations:

// Operation 1: Find the component property defined on props (Note: lowercase component) and assign it to a new location in state we call Component (Note: capital Component).
// Operation 2: Then, take all remaining properties defined on the props object and collect them inside an argument called rest.
